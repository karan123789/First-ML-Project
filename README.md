# Solubility Predictor Project

This ML Project utilizes many ML algorithsm such as Linear Regression as well as Random Forest alongside a cost function to improve hte model's performance utilizing differe ML libraries to visualize the data and make it readable to others. This ML Project is a classic Linear Regression Algorithm showing the differnce in predicted and actual value.
